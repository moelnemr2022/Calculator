# The testing module project
##  Requirements

The goal of this project is for you the recap the topics we covered in this module, and also to have a fancy project that shows of your testing skill!

In this project you should
- use react as the framework (set it up with vite)
- have at least one interacive element (input field, button, checkbox)
- have component tests for your component (with 100% test coverage). Use react-testing-library and vitest as the test runner.
- have at least one acceptance test (for the "happy" path of your code). Use the playwright testing library for this.
- Optional: if you plan to have a backend, mock the calls to the backend with the library msw (in the browser and in the tests)
- Optional: Add workflows with Git Hub Actions (build and test, or coverage)

You can use the To Do App we have built in this as a reference for how to write the different types of tests (testing for elements on the page, tests that include user interactions).

## Workflow
- Start with an idea! What do you want to build this week?
- Identify user stories and rank them (which one is most important)
- Optional: If you like to, you can create a project board on Git Hub to help with the planning and to track your progress!
- Start with the highest ranking user story. 
- Do the project set up in this repository. You can follow these instructions:

  - For the app: https://www.makeuseof.com/set-up-react-app-with-vite/
  - For react testing libraries: https://www.robinwieruch.de/vitest-react-testing-library/
  - For Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro
  - Check the demoe code from this module to see if there are any other libraries you want to install.
 
- When the first user story is done, move to the next one!

  **Remember to commit and push your code often (at least once a day)**
